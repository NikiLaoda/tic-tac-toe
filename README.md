# tic-tac-toe

Tic Tac Toe project from the Odin Project course.

How the code have to work:

LOOP {
1. Render the playing field
2. Check, if there are 3-in-row X's or O's
3. If YES:
    Show the message, which player wins
    MAYBE: add button to restart the game and add overall counter of players' wins
4. If NO:
    Remember, who played last and switch 
    Allow player to add X or O by clicking on the squares
}

Functions to make:
1. render
2. check 3-in-row TICK
3. switch of plays TICK
4. add X or O by clicking on the square
5. block square, if there are any X's or O's in it

Check 3-in-row variants
I can cycle through rows, columns and diagnals and ask, if there are 3 equalities in one of them or not => then do YES or NO path
Or I can use true/false ?

ANSWER: TRUE FALSE is correct and easy

LOOP:
one function gameLoop, which has all the functions I need to run the game

ANSWER: good choice by now

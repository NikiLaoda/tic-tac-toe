# tic-tac-toe

Tic Tac Toe project from the Odin Project course.

How the code have to work:

LOOP {
1. Render the playing field
2. Check, if there are 3-in-row X's or O's
3. If YES:
    Show the message, which player wins
    MAYBE: add button to restart the game and add overall counter of players' wins
4. If NO:
    Remember, who played last and switch 
    Allow player to add X or O by clicking on the squares
}
